I am an Assistant Professor at [Waterloo ECE](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/). I obtained my CS PhD from Yale in 2023, advised by __Ruzica Piskac__. Previously, I worked at the [RiSE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-software-engineering-rise/) and [PROSE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/prose/) team at Microsoft Research (MSR), collaborating with __Shuvendu Lahiri__, __Sumit Gulwani__, __Jose Cambronero__, __Todd Mytkowicz__ and __Vu Le__. I coached the Yale ICPC Team.

I am looking for __3+__ highly self-motivated Master, PhD, and remote interns. If you are excited about LLM/PL/SE research, send me an email to initiate exciting projects together!

<span style="color:red">!! NEWS !!</span> {{< staticref "uploads/PyDex.pdf" "newtab" >}}PyDex{{< /staticref >}} to appear at __OOPSLA 2024__! For the first time, a fully automated tool to repair both __syntactic and semantic__ errors in real-world students' Python programming assignments.

My research combines __Large Language Models (LLM)__, __Programming Languages__ and __Software Engineering__ to develop practical tools for automatically preventing, detecting, and repairing crucial errors in programs, with minimum to no human effort. Check it out:

- {{< staticref "uploads/ASE2022.pdf" "newtab" >}}Clef (ASE 2022){{< /staticref >}}: first paper in the PL/SE community on competitive programming, able to automatically repair very interesting and challenging competitive-level programs.

- {{< staticref "uploads/ISSTA2022.pdf" "newtab" >}}Gmerge (ISSTA 2022){{< /staticref >}}: using GPT-3, automatically resolved __300+__ real-world merge conflicts in Microsoft Edge (__currently under productization__).

- {{< staticref "uploads/OOPSLA2021.pdf" "newtab" >}}ConfigX (OOPSLA 2021){{< /staticref >}}: analyzing the semantics of system source code using customized static analysis, detected 2233 real silent misconfigurations in __Apache, VSFTPD and PostgreSQL__.
