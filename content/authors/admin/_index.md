I am a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor at [Waterloo ECE](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/). My research focuses on AI for programming, LLM-powered software development, and automated debugging. I obtained my CS PhD from Yale in 2023, advised by Ruzica Piskac. I have worked with the [RiSE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-software-engineering-rise/) and [PROSE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/prose/) teams at Microsoft Research (MSR), collaborating with Shuvendu Lahiri, Sumit Gulwani, Jose Cambronero, Todd Mytkowicz, and Vu Le. 

Hiring: I am actively seeking __2+__ Masters, PhDs, and interns. If you're excited about LLMs for programming, AI-driven debugging, or intelligent code assistants, email me!


<span style="color:red">!! Industry Collaborations !!</span> I am open to industry opportunities in AI-assisted software development, debugging, and program analysis. If you're working on cutting-edge AI and LLM research, let’s connect!


Featured AI/LLM Projects:

- {{< staticref "uploads/ASE2022.pdf" "newtab" >}}Gmerge (ASE){{< /staticref >}}: LLM-powered merge conflict resolution. One of the first works leveraging GPT-3 for automated software engineering, resolving 300+ real-world merge conflicts in Microsoft Edge. Currently under productization.

- {{< staticref "uploads/PyDex.pdf" "newtab" >}}PyDex (OOPSLA){{< /staticref >}}: First fully automated tool for repairing both syntactic and semantic errors in Python programming assignments. This research contributes to AI-powered code analysis and program repair, relevant for AI-driven tutoring systems (e.g., OpenAI’s Codex for Education).

- {{< staticref "uploads/ASE2022.pdf" "newtab" >}}Clef (ASE){{< /staticref >}}: First PL/SE paper on AI-assisted competitive programming. Clef automatically repairs highly complex competitive-level code.
