I am a researcher specializing in __Large Language Models (LLM) for Code__.
To enhance the productivity of programmers, we designed __Gmerge__, the first LLM-powered tool to automatically resolve __300+__ real-world merge conflicts in Microsoft Edge. [{{< staticref "uploads/ISSTA2022.pdf" "newtab" >}}Paper:Gmerge{{< /staticref >}}]

To promote CS Education, we developed [{{< staticref "uploads/PyDex.pdf" "newtab" >}}__Pydex__{{< /staticref >}}] (powered by Codex), the first unified tool with the capability to repair both syntactic and semantic errors in students' Python programs.

I took a stab at competitive programming. In the past two years, I served as the coach for the Yale ICPC Team. Research-wise, we presented __Clef__, the first paper at the top PL/SE conference on competitive programming. Clef can repair challenging incorrect competitive-level programs, including non-functional properties such as time and memory limit exceeded errors.

I received my PhD at Yale University. I am honored to be advised by __Ruzica Piskac__. 
In the summer 2021 and 2022, I interned at Microsoft Research (MSR) on Large Language Models. I was mentored by __Shuvendu Lahiri__, __Sumit Gulwani__, and __Jose Cambronero__. We had a blast.
